{"data": [{"title": "custom_question", "paragraphs": [{"context": "We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language repre- sentation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Rad- ford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre- train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a re- sult, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine- tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task- specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art re- sults on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answer- ing Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute im- provement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1", "qas": [{"answers": [], "question": "What is BERT", "id": "5156bedc-e201-4cec-b830-3d04262eb6ae"}]}]}]}
